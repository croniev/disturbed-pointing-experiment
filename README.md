# disturbed-pointing-experiment
Idea for my Bachelors Thesis. 
During a straight pointing task with the arm occluded from vision, do subjects feel physically pushed when the mouse position is distorted?

## Usage
- Conda Environment for Handeln course should work. If not install from yml file.
- run main.py
	- debug: disable fullscreen
	<!---
	- distortion (-d): set to either random (default), none, straight, rotate, repell, burst
	-->

After reaching the target the mouse has to be moved back to spawnpoint and a question is answered. Then the next trial starts.

## Papers for discussion
- Visually-updated hand state estimates modulate the proprioceptive reflex independently of motor task requirements (https://elifesciences.org/articles/52380)
